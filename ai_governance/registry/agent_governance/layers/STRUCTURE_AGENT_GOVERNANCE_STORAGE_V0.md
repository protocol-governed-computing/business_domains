# STRUCTURE_AGENT_GOVERNANCE_STORAGE_V0

## Header (Mandatory)

- **Artifact Code:** STRUCTURE_AGENT_GOVERNANCE_STORAGE_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** structure
- **Governed By:** CONSTITUTION_STRUCTURE_V0
- **Version:** v0
- **Status:** draft
- **Supersedes:** NONE

---

## 1. Intent

Declare storage topology for agent governance domain entities. Maps entity types to storage implementations and paths.

---

## 2. Rationale

Storage paths are a governance concern, not a runtime implementation detail. This STRUCTURE artifact:
- Centralizes storage topology (single source of truth)
- Decouples CC artifacts from filesystem layout
- Enforces entity-level isolation

---

## 3. Storage Model

**Principle:** One store per domain entity type.

**Entity Types:**
- LICENSE_FACTS: Read-only license tier and status feed
- GOVERNANCE_AUDIT: Append-only agent governance decision audit trail
- LICENSE_AUDIT: Append-only license lifecycle audit trail

---

  isolation:
    description: "Entity storage isolation constraints"
    rules:
      - "Each entity type has dedicated storage"
      - "LICENSE_FACTS is read-only — agent governance may not mutate license facts"
      - "GOVERNANCE_AUDIT is append-only — agent governance audit records are immutable"
      - "LICENSE_AUDIT is append-only — license audit records are immutable"
      - "Storage paths resolved via STRUCTURE only"
```
