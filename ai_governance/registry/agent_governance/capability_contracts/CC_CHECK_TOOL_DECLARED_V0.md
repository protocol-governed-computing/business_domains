# CC_CHECK_TOOL_DECLARED_V0

## Header (Mandatory)

- **Artifact Code:** CC_CHECK_TOOL_DECLARED_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** capability_contract
- **Governed By:** CONSTITUTION_CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_V0
- **Version:** v0
- **Status:** draft
- **Supersedes:** NONE
- **Dependencies:** CT_PURE_VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP_V0

## 1. Intent

Verify that the requested tool exists in the closed tool registry.

---

## 2. Rationale

Tool declaration is the second governance gate:
- Only declared tools may be referenced
- The tool surface is closed — undeclared tools are structurally absent
- This enforces Invariant I-A2 (Closed Tool Surface)

---

## 3. Pipeline

| Step | Capability | Type | Operation |
|------|------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | CT_PURE_VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP_V0 | CT | VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP |

## 4. Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| tool_name | string | true | Requested tool identifier |

---

## 5. Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| is_declared | boolean | Whether tool is in the closed registry |

---

## 6. Result Status Contract

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| SUCCESS | Tool is declared |
| VIOLATION | Tool is not declared |
