# CC_CHECK_AGENT_TOOL_DECLARED_V0

## Header (Mandatory)

- **Artifact Code:** CC_CHECK_AGENT_TOOL_DECLARED_V0
- **Artifact Kind:** capability_contract
- **Governed By:** CONSTITUTION_CAPABILITY_CONTRACT_V0
- **Version:** v0
- **Status:** draft
- **Supersedes:** NONE
- **Dependencies:** CT_PURE_VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP_V0

---

## 1. Intent

Verify that the requested tool exists in the closed autonomous agent tool registry.

---

## 2. Rationale

Tool declaration is the second governance gate in the admission workflow:
- Only declared agent tools may be proposed for execution
- The agent tool surface is closed — undeclared tools are structurally absent, not filtered
- Cannot reuse CC_CHECK_TOOL_DECLARED_V0 — that CC contains licensing operations (READ_RECORD, PROVISION_*)
- Phase 1 agent tool surface: web_search, read_file, write_file

## 3. Pipeline

| Step | Capability | Type | Operation |
|------|------------|------|-----------|
| 1 | CT_PURE_VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP_V0 | CT | VALIDATE_SET_MEMBERSHIP |

---

## 4. Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| tool_name | string | true | Requested tool identifier from closed agent tool registry |

---

## 5. Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| is_declared | boolean | Whether tool exists in the closed agent tool registry |

---

## 6. Result Status Contract

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| SUCCESS | Tool is in the closed agent tool registry |
| VIOLATION | Tool is not declared — structurally absent |
